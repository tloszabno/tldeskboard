The idea is to make old tablet alive, put it on my private desk and present most important daily information for me.

I want to present:
- [ ] daily TODOs from wunderlist
- [ ] clock
- [ ] one random quotation from bible for the day
- [ ] daily events from gcalendar 
- [ ] some random photo from my private library as "screensaver" 

Server will run on raspberry pi 2B.
